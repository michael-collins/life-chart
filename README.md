# Diem computare

I've been thinking about my age a lot, and I wanted a vizualizer for how many weeks I've made it through so far in life. The screenshot does not represent _my_ age.

Use this chart tool to visuzalize the number of weeks since a birth date. You can also use it to visualize the number of weeks left in a given number of years. Perhaps that will be motivation to live a fuller life?
